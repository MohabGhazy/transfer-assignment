# Strengths
1-Distributed version control: Git is a distributed version control system, which means that each user has their own copy of the entire repository, including its full history. This makes it easy for multiple users to collaborate on a project without needing to be connected to a central server all the time. Each user can work independently, commit changes to their local repository, and then push those changes to a shared repository when they are ready.
